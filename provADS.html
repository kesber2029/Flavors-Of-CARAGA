                            Lying in the heart of CARAGA, Agusan del Sur is a province of wide rivers, lowland marshes
                            and deep forest — a place where food and culture are shaped by water, harvest cycles and
                            long-standing indigenous traditions. The great Agusan River threads the province from north
                            to south and feeds the Agusan Marsh, the largest wetland in the Philippines; these waterways
                            are more than landmarks here, they are lifeblood — transporting people and produce, shaping
                            local recipes, and anchoring community stories.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            This landscape gives Agusan del Sur a reputation as a quietly resilient agricultural
                            heartland. Rice and corn dominate the fields, while banana and coconut groves edge the
                            highways; fishing the river and lakes supplies the fresh, humble proteins that appear at
                            nearly every kitchen table. The province’s economy and foodways remain closely tied to the
                            seasons and to small-scale producers — farmers, fishermen, and indigenous harvesters who
                            continue practices passed down through generations.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            Culturally, Agusan del Sur is a mosaic. Several indigenous peoples — including Manobo and
                            Higaonon groups — maintain visible presence and influence in the province, keeping songs,
                            craft traditions and rice-field rituals alive even as migrant communities from the Visayas
                            and Luzon have changed the demographic mix. Festivals and community events often highlight
                            indigenous dances, storytelling and forest-to-table food traditions, giving visitors a
                            chance to see how heritage and everyday life overlap.

                            What you’ll taste in Agusan del Sur is straightforward, seasonal and built around what the
                            land and river provide.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            - Sinuglaw (smoke + cure): A regional favorite described as a pleasing marriage of two
                            techniques — grilled or smoky elements (“sinugba”) paired with raw cured components
                            (“kinilaw”). Sinuglaw celebrates freshness and contrast: charred meat or fish paired with
                            bright, vinegar- or citrus-based dressings. It’s one of the province’s dishes that speaks to
                            both river harvests and coastal influences.
                        </p>

                            - River fish dishes (tinolang isda, grilled tilapia, stews): Freshwater fish such as
                            tilapia, mudfish and catfish appear in comforting broths and simple grilled preparations.
                            Tinolang-style fish soups — light, gingered broths with local greens — are typical comfort
                            food, emphasizing the clean flavors of the river catch.

                            = Sticky rice cakes and budbud: Rice cakes wrapped in banana leaves — commonly called budbud
                            or supas in parts of Mindanao — are must-try treats. They show up in breakfast stalls and
                            festivals alike, often enjoyed with coffee or hot chocolate.
                        </p>

                            - Adobong sahang and shellfish specialties: In rivers and freshwater bodies, small shellfish
                            are harvested and turned into flavorful, bell-pepper and vinegar-forward stews
                            (adobo-style). Local food blogs and guides note these smaller, locally cherished
                            preparations among must-try items for visitors.
