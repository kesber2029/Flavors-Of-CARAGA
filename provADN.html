                        <p class="prov-text">
                            Located in the northern part of the CARAGA region, Agusan del Norte is shaped by the lower
                            Agusan River basin and the coastal edge along Butuan Bay. The province’s landscape shifts
                            from river flats and delta plains to rolling terrain and forested uplands — a geography that
                            supports rice paddies, coconut groves and other small-scale agriculture while also producing
                            abundant freshwater catches from the river and nearby bays.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            Agusan del Norte maintains a close cultural and economic relationship with Butuan — the
                            historic maritime city on the Agusan River — though Butuan itself is a highly urbanized city
                            administratively separate from the province. The provincial capital is Cabadbaran, and local
                            life here mixes coastal and riverine harvests with farm produce and a tradition of
                            small-scale trading that has long connected inland and coastal communities.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            Because the Agusan River and its tributaries dominate daily life, foodways emphasize fresh
                            fish and simple preparations that showcase seasonal ingredients. The province is also known
                            for its role in Philippine maritime history (the Balangay boats found near Butuan) and for
                            community river events and coastal markets that keep old recipes and street snacks in
                            regular circulation.

                            Agusan del Norte’s food is accessible and rooted in what the valley and coast supply — rice,
                            coconut, river fish and sweet cassava-based snacks.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            - Balikutsa (coconut toffee): A crunchy, sweet coconut candy made from reduced coconut and
                            sugar — the sort of locally made treat often found in markets and roadside stalls.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            - Nilusak (mashed cassava or root treat): A simple comfort snack made from mashed cassava
                            (or mixed root ingredients) often finished with grated coconut or latik; it’s a common home-
                            and market-made sweet in the region.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            - River and coastal fish preparations: Freshwater tilapia, mudfish and small river catches
                            are commonly grilled, stewed or made into light, sour kinilaw-style salads; near the bay,
                            simple grilled fish and seafood remain staples of everyday meals.
                        </p>
                        <p class="prov-text">
                            - Local rice cakes and snacks: You’ll also find an array of rice-based kakanin wrapped in
                            banana leaves and sold at wet markets and festivals — snacks that pair perfectly with coffee
                            and neighborhood gatherings.
